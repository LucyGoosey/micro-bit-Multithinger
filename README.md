# Multithinger

Turns your micro:bit into many (currently useless) things!

## Installation

## Usage

Use the A/B buttons to change screens.

* Temperature - Shows the temperature of the micro:bit processor and, ostensibly, the ambient temperature of the room.
* Image - Shows a random image, changes every 5 seconds.
